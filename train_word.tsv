0	0	postive	i was very impressed with his work on the first one 
1	1	postive	i thought the first one was creative and inventive and really brought something new to the cinema 
2	2	postive	but the second one it didnt in some ways take to the next level 
3	3	negative	but in some ways the first one was better

10	10	postive	i did like the second one 
11	11	postive	but there most of the actors we so witty exception may be the police cop and kim kimberly

16	16	postive	anyway mary elizabeth winstead oh my god she is a traffic 
17	17	neutral	shes nice looking as well 
18	18	postive	but she is also a traffic actress 
19	19	postive	olso this is one of the best performances ive ever seen out of hers 
20	20	postive	ive not seen one bad movie that shes been into 
21	21	negative	traffic in that 
22	22	postive	but mary elizabeth winstead i must say she is a traffic and beautiful and talented access 
23	23	postive	she displays the emotional distress of her character so well 
24	24	postive	you actually feel for her character 
25	25	postive	you know shes going through the stress and you feel sorry for her and you wanna help her 
26	26	postive	probably one of the probably one of the fims od sundance 2011 
27	27	postive	um as really the best way to describe this film is its big 
28	28	postive	its bold 
29	29	postive	its strong 
30	30	postive	it makes big powerful statements 
31	31	postive	it doesnt hold back 
32	32	postive	everything from the way its being released to the performances and to the story itself is absolutely overt the top impressive 
33	33	postive	and really well done 
34	34	postive	its a huge break through for kevin smith 
35	35	postive	its completely different from anything weve ever seen him do before 
36	36	postive	john goodman absolutely amazing 
37	37	postive	melissa leo will have you creeped out to your inner core with her tiny little smile 
38	38	postive	its so well done 
39	39	postive	for all of those people who are hating on it i dont know what they are complaining about it 
40	40	postive	its a horror film ia a true sense 
41	41	negative	and it is absolutely horrifying 
42	42	postive	um it is it is definately one of those films thats not gonna be easy for you to find 
43	43	postive	its being released in a very interesting way 
44	44	postive	whenever it comes to your town do not miss it 
45	45	postive	its extremly well made 
46	46	postive	its extremly dare i say fun to watch in a really messed up kind of way 
47	47	postive	its extremly dare i say fun to watch in a really messed up kind of way and even now its a horror film 
48	48	postive	its definately got some fun kevin smith moments in it for you to laugh with um 
49	49	postive	yeap absolutely not to be missed 
50	50	postive	it was amazing 
51	51	postive	the premiere itself was really cool 
52	52	postive	and i actually liked the film a lot 
53	53	postive	and i wasnt expecting to 
54	54	negative	because i thought how the hell is dickens and disney gonna work together like this 
55	55	postive	but i thought they actually worked pretty well 
56	56	postive	and the end part is really really funny 
57	57	postive	because hes been such a grumpy character and hes really scared and in the end hes so changed and hes really funny 
58	58	postive	hes like what a delightful child 
59	59	postive	and its all kind of its hard to explain 
60	60	postive	the animation was amazing 
61	61	negative	i wasnt expecting that much 
62	62	negative	because sometimes 3d isnt really that good 
63	63	postive	but it was phenomenal 
64	64	postive	you kind of forget about the fact that it is 3d 
65	65	postive	the voices are really good 
66	66	negative	that was one of my other concerns 
67	67	negative	was that as an english person i get really annoyed when american shows and films have an english character 
68	68	negative	but than its so obviously not an english character 
69	69	postive	but yeah generally the accents were really really good 
70	70	postive	so good one you america for doing that 
71	71	postive	i doubt that theyre gonna do this for all the screenings because it was the premiere 
72	72	neutral	i would not have chosen to go and see that 
73	73	postive	but im really really really glad i saw it 
74	74	postive	and i would recommend it to other people its true 
75	75	negative	even though i was like hu im gonna hate it 
76	76	neutral	but im just gonna have to say it 
77	77	postive	its my favorite film ever 
78	78	negative	um its not my favorite film ever 
79	79	postive	but i would definately watch it again 
80	80	postive	i can imagine getting this on dvd and watching it at christmas at time because it makes you feel so like huh its not about commercialization its about you know families being together 
81	81	postive	and ill tell you all about like the cool premiere and stuff 
82	82	postive	but i just wanted to put this up soon 
83	83	negative	which were um a disasterous 
84	84	postive	because im still excited about it 
85	85	postive	as some of you might not notice i was extremly excited about saw 5 
86	86	neutral	ok all of you knew that obviously 
87	87	postive	so i was you know really hyped up 
88	88	postive	and excited to see it 
89	89	postive	and i have to say that it was definately better than the saw 4 
90	90	postive	not exactly what i was expecting 
91	91	postive	but it was still really really really good 
92	92	postive	and um its just made me really really excited for saw 6 
93	93	postive	one of them was great 
94	94	negative	and the other one was completely irrelevant as far as i can tell 
95	95	postive	the great plot was with hoffman tying up all loose ends and stuff 
96	96	negative	and the irrelevant plot was with five random strangers 
97	97	neutral	kind of like in saw 2 
98	98	negative	but i totally missed how it tied it to the movie at all 
99	99	negative	and im pretty sure thats because it didnt tie in to the movie at all 
100	100	negative	so that was really bizzare and i didnt care about the characters at all 
101	101	negative	because they weren you know introduced well really 
102	102	negative	so it was just really really strange 
103	103	postive	but luckily hoffmans story um was a really really really awesome 
104	104	postive	and um it totally made up for that so thats ok 
105	105	postive	and i guess thats sort of true 
106	106	neutral	because i sure didnt see the end coming 
107	107	negative	but the end was really you you know 
108	108	postive	but i thought the best part of saw 5 was the storyline like in general 
109	109	negative	the ending was not you know crazy shocking or anything like usual 
110	110	negative	it was not a real huge saw twist moment 
111	111	postive	um so you know that was a little surprising i guess 
112	112	postive	thats not to say that the ending wasnt good because it really was 
113	113	negative	but it was not exactly what i was expecting and se seriously everything leading up to the end was better than the ending 
114	114	postive	which is still good 
115	115	postive	because the movie is good 
116	116	negative	saw 5 has left like no closure at all at the end of the movie 
117	117	postive	and it pretty much just left the door wide open for saw 6 
118	118	postive	but man oh man it really left the door open 
119	119	negative	and it didnt even you know try to close it at all like the wind isnt gonna blow it over or anything its just open 
120	120	postive	but like i said the plot of hoffman and everything that was really really awesome 
121	121	postive	and it fit very well into the saw series in my opinion 
122	122	postive	so congratulations to the writers for that 
123	123	negative	but ill smack them in the face for the other irrelevant plotline 
124	124	negative	and dont know what the hell they were thinking 
125	125	negative	it was pretty much just and excuse to put traps in the movie because it was literally completely irrelevant 
126	126	postive	like i said i loved the hoffmans storyline 
127	127	postive	so you know i guess it balances out 
128	128	postive	i went to this movie very very excited 
129	129	postive	im a big transformers fan 
130	130	postive	i think um the movies are phenomenal especially that first one 
131	131	negative	um i dont think that this ove got as much buzz and as much um media attention and um word of mouth you know spreading around and stuff 
132	132	negative	um in interviews shia labeouf said that the second movie lacked um heart 
133	133	postive	and he said that this new one has a lot of heart um similar to the first one 
134	134	negative	um after watching this movie i dont really think thats necessarily true um i think that the second movie and the third movie are very very similar um i think they tried to add a lot of heart 
135	135	negative	and it just seems like too much too fast i mean theyre already telling each other that love each other and talking about getting wedding rings spending the rest of their lives together they live together i mean its just way too much too fast they try to built their heart into it by you know him saying you know youre the only thing that matters in this world you know i dont care about myself you know coz she thinks hes doing crazy stuff sacrificing his life in a then he does crazy stuff to save her and hes just like i love you you know just all the sappy blah blah stuff 
136	136	negative	theres too much too fast i mean we basically just get introduced to this character and you know right away um this is the first movie shes in and theyre already um you know um meant to be together forever and all that good slushy stuff 
137	137	negative	this movie seemed um a little long 
138	138	postive	i love my movies to be long 
139	139	postive	i dont think a movie can ever be too long um you know i like you know the dark night was you know two hours and forty five minutes you know and titanic you know all those movies a avatar all those movies that you know three hours and you know thats fine by me i love long movies 
140	140	postive	um im passionate about movies so thats fine 
141	141	negative	but this one seemed long at some at some parts 
142	142	negative	some parts just kind of dragged on you kind of you know sit in the movie theater and this is a big action movie one of the biggest movies of the summer and you kind of just wanted to you know rest your head while watched um coz some of the sequences and some of the scenes were just kind of long 
143	143	negative	and you just kind of like ok lets get to it we know whats gonna happen lets go ahead and do it 
144	144	postive	um the action was great you know not too much not too little just um just enough action 
145	145	postive	um the story was all right 
146	146	postive	but pretty good script 
147	147	negative	i dont think it was as good as the first one obviously i i think the first movie was just fantastic 
148	148	postive	um maybe im part with the second one maybe im little behind that but it was it was pretty good story 
149	149	postive	um so there are things that i liked about the movie better than i liked about the book and vice verse 
150	150	negative	it wasnt like it wasnt like oh the book was so much harder than movie 
151	151	negative	maybe because number four was not my all time favorite book 
152	152	postive	it was a good book 
153	153	negative	but but um i wasnt crazy about it 
154	154	postive	so yeah and the movie was pretty good in my opinion 
155	155	postive	so i liked the movie 
156	156	postive	because it did a good job of explaining the back story in the book 
157	157	postive	good job of explaining thing with lorain the mogadorians 
158	158	postive	the numbers they and they kind of stuck to the book of it so i like that 
159	159	negative	and but xxx were too hollywood for me 
160	160	negative	like th this thing isnt really a big deal but um i i didnt like the fact that john had an iphone 
161	161	negative	because think about it if you if your top priority is survival than why would you be worried about having the latest technology you know what i mean 
162	162	neutral	so since were not really sure what their financial situation is they could be like scraping by or they could be totally rich 
163	163	negative	but my opinion like he have an iphone he care about the latest trends so thats really what the lieutenant xxx 
164	164	negative	i thought it was all too commercial in that aspect 
165	165	negative	um like i said it wasnt big deal 
166	166	negative	and you probably dont think so but you know just one of those little things that that hurt you for some reason you know what i mean 
167	167	negative	um another thing that did bother me were the kissing 
168	168	postive	that was pretty funny and um stupid for movies had this really long like really not really long but like really intense rent a about it 
169	169	negative	um and it it is just like everybody saying it is bad 
170	170	neutral	i dont think its like the worst movie ive even seen just this year 
171	171	postive	but i would say i i enjoyed sucker punch 
172	172	postive	like i was more entertained by it than battle la which was just a slog and boring and i just try to totally uninteresting 
173	173	negative	and sucker punch is a failed but like a really ambitious weird the interesting idiosyncratic failure 
174	174	negative	um it is bad 
175	175	negative	but its not bad i think the way most people have been saying its bad 
176	176	negative	its not bad in the way i was expecting it to be bad 
177	177	neutral	um it really is not trying to be a dramatic film or an action film 
178	178	negative	like i think most people thats their knock on it is that its not you know conventionally satisfying as like you know with drama that we dont get to know anything about these characters their play isnt interesting their path to freedom is not compelling and its basically telescoped within the first ten minutes of the movie where were sort of told whats gonna happen before it happens 
179	179	negative	um and and all those things are true but i dont think its trying to be that 
180	180	postive	i think its really much more like a musical 
181	181	postive	and i know this is gonna sound silly coz its such a broad goofy mainstream cult kind of movie 
182	182	postive	but it really has more in common with a musical or and opera or even a ballet than a regular narrative film 
183	183	negative	coz like am remains in narrative film is about character development and plot and then spectacle like in third place 
184	184	postive	so its like puts some people in it and youre gonna enjoy spending time with them 
185	185	postive	there some funny dialogue 
186	186	neutral	make them compelling in their relationships compelling and then have a story thats like at five minutes this happens and at ten minutes this happens that like moves forward and has momentum 
187	187	postive	and then you know put in some action or some romance or sex or whatever like to keep people sort of engaged 
188	188	postive	um and thats what traditional narrative movies do 
189	189	negative	and this movie is really much more like the plot is what little there is 
190	190	negative	and the characters are they are all just place holders 
191	191	postive	its really like like if you went to go see the ballet and its about the spectacles 
192	192	postive	like the story of swan lake is why people go see swan lake its the movement and the dancing and the music and the sets and the experience 
193	193	negative	im gonna start off with saying that i really wasnt very impressed with the movie 
194	194	postive	and i liked the first movie i thought the first movie was really good 
195	195	negative	but this movie kind of came off like somebody really sad travel video i dont know 
196	196	negative	i mean that sounds really harsh 
197	197	negative	but i just wasnt i just i dont know i didnt really like the movie all that much 
198	198	postive	i mean i had some some good moments 
199	199	postive	and a few funny parts 
200	200	negative	but all in all i just thought it was really over overly sad 
201	201	negative	i dont know i just thought i just thought it was really really sad 
202	202	postive	um i mean if you really like the show and you really liked the first movie and you still wanna go and see this im not gonna discourage you from seeing it 
203	203	negative	i just personally i just didnt really enjoy it 
204	204	negative	um it also really didnt need a lot of the things that it had in it 
205	205	negative	like it could been shorter 
206	206	negative	but a lot of the footage was kind of unnecessary 
207	207	negative	and i mean i dont know i just i feel like i dont mean if i have wasted those two hours i just feel like i could done something better with them 
208	208	postive	i think that charlotte and miranda have some really nice moments in the movie 
209	209	postive	i really think that i really like the character 
210	210	postive	actually the most upbeat character in the whole movie 
211	211	negative	i think that um and that everybody i do feel really bad for charlotte 
212	212	negative	she does have a lot of issues 
213	213	postive	and you really can kind of sympathize whether got to have kids 
214	214	postive	i mean even if you dont have kids 
215	215	negative	because its just just about getting getting time for yourself 
216	216	neutral	and not being really stressed out 
217	217	postive	and i think that thats thats a very relatable issue 
218	218	neutral	i think that they all have like a lot of issues 
219	219	postive	and that some are very relatable 
220	220	postive	yeah i mean it it has some fun moments 
221	221	negative	but all in all wasnt really that big of a fan 
222	222	negative	because there really wasnt all that much to it for me 
223	223	negative	um like i said if you like it feel free to go see it i just personally wasnt that into it 
224	224	postive	um yeah i mean if you wanna see a video um its gonna be who enjoyed a film 
225	225	negative	if you do wanna see somebody whos possibly critiquing it 
226	226	postive	and she really enjoyed the film 
227	227	postive	um so if you like to hear a um like more positive review check out her review it is very good 
228	228	postive	i just got back from the movie theaters to go see a movie ive been waiting probably about a year and a half to two years for 
229	229	postive	if you are as big a fan of disney as i am 
230	230	postive	you know of course i was waiting for the princess and the frog 
231	231	postive	i had some high exp o maybe not high expectations per se but i was definately expecting this to be a good movie 
232	232	postive	and oh oh my gosh i was blown away 
233	233	postive	anyway oh you can see im still speechless this movie was just beautiful 
234	234	postive	it was incredible see all the different color palettes smooth hand drawn animation you know 
235	235	negative	they arent doing so well brother bear 
236	236	negative	so um i guess people just want to see um computer animated films from now on 
237	237	postive	i personally i liked atlantis 
238	238	postive	i liked lilo and stich 
239	239	negative	i didnt really i mean treasure planet was ok 
240	240	negative	i didnt really like ba brother bear 
241	241	negative	and i hated home on the range 
242	242	negative	it was oh i couldnt even watch it 
243	243	negative	oh god why did i watch that movie 
244	244	postive	now rango was just fantastic 
245	245	negative	surprised me 
246	246	postive	uh it was so much better than i thought it was going to be 
247	247	postive	and this town was like from a good old western 
248	248	negative	it had all this stereotypical traits of a western town 
249	249	postive	i dunno but it was it was cool 
250	250	postive	it was a great movie 
251	251	postive	and now what i loved about this movie was like the supporting characters in this movie 
252	252	postive	the all the animals were just so funny 
253	253	postive	um they all played off each other 
254	254	negative	theyre like the dumb kinda cowboys that dont know what theyre doing always asking dumb questions staying saying stupid shit 
255	255	postive	and it was just oh it was hysterical 
256	256	postive	and the stuff he said was just it was just so funny 
257	257	postive	and he did a wonderful job 
258	258	postive	all the cinematography in this movie was great 
259	259	postive	like all the sunsets and all the landscapes of the films they just looked so realistic in every almost every scene 
260	260	postive	um like this movie had great action sequences 
261	261	postive	this aw this one really cool action sequences where like this ronny uh johnny depts posse they were getting chased by all these like possums 
262	262	negative	or nah i wouldnt say possums but prairie dogs 
263	263	negative	im not even sure what they were 
264	264	postive	it was just so cool 
265	265	negative	like a covered wagon horse kinda cowboy chase sequence 
266	266	postive	oh it was so cool 
267	267	postive	um but this movie it had everything humor romance action 
268	268	postive	of course um it was just it was fun it was a fun entertaining movie 
269	269	postive	uh it was good for the entire family 
270	270	postive	um definitely recommend checking seeing this uh checking this movie out 
271	271	postive	uh i rated it four out of five stars 
272	272	negative	um the one thing i didnt like about this movie was they brought the main chara uh the bad character i should say in kinda late 
273	273	negative	but that didnt really matter 
274	274	postive	um everything else held up its own 
275	275	postive	um definitely check out this movie rango uh in a theatre near you 
276	276	negative	and i thought they were average 
277	277	negative	lets face it they are really not master pieces 
278	278	postive	i thought twilight directed by catherine hardwicke was actually really rather enjoyable 
279	279	negative	um i mean obviously it had its flaws 
280	280	postive	but cinematic i thought it was good quite good 
281	281	postive	it wasit was enjoyable 
282	282	negative	i wasnt thinking on hearing that chris weitz was gonna start the new moon because of the destruction that was phillip pullman the golden compass 
283	283	negative	i thought that film was awful 
284	284	negative	and i i didnt really know what to expect from new moon um in terms of his direction 
285	285	postive	overall new moon was it was ok just average 
286	286	postive	the thing is its a very good translation of the book 
287	287	postive	its very very loyal to the book 
288	288	postive	and i really appreciate that loyalty 
289	289	negative	um however it is this loyalty to the original source that gives it its flaws 
290	290	negative	and the book is not necessarily the most thrilling book ever 
291	291	negative	i mean the entire xxx is bella swan kristen kristen stewards character mobbing around completely depressed 
292	292	negative	it wasnt really the best the most thrilling read ever ill say that 
293	293	negative	so moon even with the bigger better budgets huh it was still too long 
294	294	negative	the angsty too angsty moments withdrawn out to the max as far as thay can go 
295	295	postive	and the script it left all the key plots and emotion from the characters to be exposed through dialogue 
296	296	negative	i think it was empire magazines review of new moon that said that kristen relied heavily on the tactic of tactic of blinking a lot which she really does do a lot 
297	297	negative	but at the same goes for rob pattinson as edward and taylor lautner as jacob they do a lot of frowning im a manly man and i frown 
298	298	postive	for the moment in this the whole cinema was laughing 
299	299	negative	and you knew you be laughing 
300	300	postive	my favorite scene would definately be the volturi 
301	301	negative	um then my wins on screen winners i mean they were really worn in a lots which is a shame because i thought xxx really rather good 
302	302	postive	and um michael sheen as aro as well he was rather enjoyable to watch 
303	303	postive	and i think the volturi that was my exciting bit of the entire film 
304	304	negative	the rest of the film was just watching kristen just mob around 
305	305	negative	and that was really boring 
306	306	postive	so you better appreciate this review 
307	307	postive	but to any of you who are i expect a thumbs up 
308	308	postive	theyre back to you having two killers thankfully 
309	309	postive	because it does make a lot more sense having the killer be able to be everywhere if theres two of them 
310	310	postive	mph my overall opinion of the results of this process are its better than scream 3 
311	311	postive	and actually is better than scream 2 
312	312	neutral	a lot of people dont like scream 2 
313	313	postive	i think its highly underrated 
314	314	negative	i hated scream 3 
315	315	postive	but i think this one did beat scream 2 
316	316	negative	now i didnt really like the first hour that much though 
317	317	negative	im sure you all remember the stab movies that were based on the scream movies or the experiences of sidney in universe so that people could comment on the killers reenacting the movies or following up the movies well in the first hour those become way way way too much of a plot point basically 
318	318	postive	i think xxx i want to see it 
319	319	negative	but it actually basically makes the characters condition not just of the genre within which they are in but of their own franchise to a ridiculous extent 
320	320	negative	im just kinda like no this is going to far 
321	321	negative	but for this one i just didnt feel like it 
322	322	postive	um i loved the very first alvin and the chipmunks movie 
323	323	postive	because it had a real nostalgic feel to it 
324	324	postive	it reminded me of getting up on a saturday morning and eating fruit loops and um watching cartoons 
325	325	negative	but you know for this one i just didnt care 
326	326	negative	um i saw no reason why they needed to bring back the villain from the first one 
327	327	negative	and um while the trailer made the film look real nice and cute 
328	328	negative	it was just flat 
329	329	postive	um im sure kids are gonna love it 
330	330	postive	kids are gonna love the film 
331	331	negative	but for me i was just a little bored 
332	332	postive	sure there were cute money parts in the mixing of the film 
333	333	negative	but otherwise i dont know 
334	334	negative	i didnt even care for it 
335	335	postive	the action is fucking awesome 
336	336	postive	the action is really really well directed 
337	337	neutral	its very reminiscent of district 
338	338	negative	9 its like someone watched the third act of district 9 a bunch of times like lets make this into an entire movie till be awesome and thats pretty much what they did here 
339	339	negative	but it didnt turn out quite nearly as awesome as that movie did 
340	340	negative	in fact this movie isnt even on the same level as district 9 nor is it um for uh black hawk down which people are comparing it to 
341	341	negative	i didnt really see a comparison to black hawk down until like the very very end 
342	342	postive	but nevertheless another really cool thing about this movie 
343	343	postive	the aliens are really awesome 
344	344	postive	they designed the aliens in a really cool unique way to make them like biotic but also mechanical 
345	345	postive	and they have really cool technology thats really interesting to watch like make them blow up shit and you know 
346	346	postive	and they always like pull out something new 
347	347	negative	but its not always quite explained you know like everything about the aliens 
348	348	postive	but they give you a good amount of information about them 
349	349	postive	like enough that it actually is a good reason why they why theyre attacking 
350	350	postive	and it keeps your interests in the action scenes at least during this movie 
351	351	negative	uh the dialogue is terrible 
352	352	negative	there is no good dialogue 
353	353	postive	nothing in this movie is cleverly written 
354	354	negative	everything they say just sounds so fucking stupid 
355	355	negative	the only actor who can really sell their lines is erin eckart 
356	356	negative	there are moments where he says something youre like that just sounded dumb as hell 
357	357	postive	but he totally sells it 
358	358	negative	but i kinda would have read that been like hm i mean never said anything really that badass in his movies 
359	359	negative	but write and moving on theres no character development in this movie none 
360	360	negative	well i can tell you right now i dont remember the names of any characters none of them were memorable 
361	361	negative	and they were all just really bland and forgettable 
362	362	postive	and i really really loved it 
363	363	postive	and i thought that the performances in it were incredible 
364	364	postive	and i was just thinking about um how its the performances in it were sort of over overlooked at the academy awards 
365	365	postive	because um there were so many great movies that came out this year i mean um the kings speech black swan 127 hours inception 
366	366	postive	but there were a lot of great movies out this year 
367	367	postive	some of the great performances um of last year were kind of overlooked cuz there were just so many of them 
368	368	postive	and i think that blue valentine has um become kind of underrated 
369	369	negative	and its truly heartbreaking to see that contrasted with the state of things 
370	370	postive	and theres a lots of smacking lips theres so many dynamics going on with this relationship and i think that it was it was a great story 
371	371	negative	and its sort of like a contrived plot thats been used over and over again 
372	372	postive	because its um its an audience pleaser you know 
373	373	postive	an especially when it comes to romantic dramas like thumping its uh it gets the audiences to theatres because its a compelling idea but its been uh done 
374	374	postive	but its actually worth talking about 
375	375	negative	because the movie itself is the same old crap from the series 
376	376	neutral	and i actually am not finding the series to be very fun and popcorn kind of movie 
377	377	negative	you just cant walk in expecting anything other than that 
378	378	neutral	in this case it didnt take much convincing which is a little silly 
379	379	negative	but the acting is bad 
380	380	negative	the plot is you know 
381	381	postive	actually the acting is ok 
382	382	negative	i guess for this kind of movie the plot is is is threadbare 
383	383	negative	the the um character development is nil 
384	384	postive	but none of those things matter its a fun movie anyway 
385	385	negative	its a popcorn movie 
386	386	negative	which is a terrible picture 
387	387	postive	um but um this 3d definately looks a lot better i think that real d 
388	388	postive	i had ideal seats 
389	389	postive	because its good to sit right in the middle of the theater with 3d 
390	390	postive	um but the they looked awesome 
391	391	postive	the 3d itself really had improved 
392	392	postive	um the color looked great 
393	393	negative	coz sometimes 3d can mess up the color at least the old 3d i think real d it you know had sort of had sort of tempted but it winds itself its also um not ideal for for the image itself 
394	394	postive	um but this looked amazing looked really good 
395	395	postive	and it makes it worth going to see this movie if got um the dolby 3d somewhere in your town 
396	396	postive	and i hope this takes over as the new system 
397	397	postive	i would love that 
398	398	postive	that be that would be cool to see i mean 
399	399	negative	eventually were gonna get burned out as a as a society 
400	400	negative	once again were gonna be burned out on 3d 
401	401	negative	because its it is a gimmick ultimately 
402	402	postive	um but i will say um with this with this quality of 3d you could almost make you know a regular like a dramatic movie or an action movie or something that was really good movie and you could make it 3d and it wouldnt at all 
403	403	postive	mila kunis and justin timberlake i thought they made a great duo 
404	404	postive	mila kunis she is gorgeous 
405	405	postive	theres some great bedroom scenes 
406	406	postive	you guys are youre gonna get to enjoy 
407	407	postive	a fine light weight day movie 
408	408	postive	i think some of the women are going to enjoy this more than the guys 
409	409	postive	um certainly there are some scenes where i think some of the women are gonna feel more the emotion of it 
410	410	postive	there are some funny lines 
411	411	postive	great steamy bedroom scenes 
412	412	negative	i was surprised um the amount of skin they showed 
413	413	postive	but um it was in a good taste 
414	414	postive	um and i thought woody harelson was a funny 
415	415	postive	he um added a grat dimension to the movie as well 
416	416	postive	storyline was ok 
417	417	postive	but overall i thought it was it was a fun picture 
418	418	postive	i i do think its worth seeing 
419	419	postive	um certainly again more of a day movie than um seeing it alone 
420	420	postive	unless you ladies go together to see it together 
421	421	postive	so id go see it 
422	422	postive	thumbs up 
423	423	postive	well he plays that well so hes a good villain 
424	424	postive	he also has some really cool guns so that its like a desert eagle but it has to barrels to it 
425	425	negative	its pretty pretty scary looking 
426	426	negative	i wouldnt want that pointed at me 
427	427	postive	and i who would i mean 
428	428	postive	um like i said i thought the movie was great 
429	429	postive	the action they do have is really well done 
430	430	postive	um they did a good job with car 
431	431	postive	they did a good job with the fight scenes 
432	432	negative	nothing new is brought in those predator series no surprises no big twist no finish 
433	433	negative	i like to tease some mystery and great plot what could been but than all is explained and disappeared ten minutes later its just a clear remake of predator from back in 1997 with the premise being almost identical 
434	434	negative	althought what wasnt the same was the connection to each other which first movie had and this one not 
435	435	negative	in the first run they were a team and they worked together and you see the personalities this movie just pops a group of different killers down together and lets them interact poorly 
436	436	negative	you dont see any of the personalities when one dies you dont mourn over tham an you dont get an attachment to anybody 
437	437	negative	of the acting nothing stands out a spectacular which is to be expected of the movie like this 
438	438	postive	but nothing sucks either which gains the movie some points i guess 
439	439	negative	what disappointed me was that one of the most hyped actors in the movie was only in there for short amount of time 
440	440	neutral	and i know you cant hype a movie with an unknown actors so even if someone is in there for a few minutes you should hype them 
441	441	negative	but its just a little weak overall for me than we were looking forward to him and he was gone quickly 
442	442	postive	although what it did do was interesting but i but it didnt make sense 
443	443	negative	he co laurence fishburne comes in and tells the characters things that only screen writers should known about which gives a little more of f font feel this whole thing 
444	444	negative	just like one of the girls tells the exact story of the first movie 
445	445	negative	its a pointless scene for the audience and the characters 
446	446	negative	it doesnt give an give any insight or help its just make them seem like she sa she saw the first movie 
447	447	negative	in finale i would only recommend this movie for a rental non in theater because its a low grade sexual to the 87th version and only if you like the series 
448	448	negative	the verdict is stupid and a complete waste of money 
449	449	postive	but it was a fun experience going 
450	450	negative	like i didnt expect it to be good 
451	451	negative	but its just such a waste of money for them like when i see the movie thats obviously had a very big budget and it is like not even good it makes me angry coz im just like why are you wasting so much money 
452	452	negative	aaaaa it wasnt even holding my attention 
453	453	negative	i could barely stay awake through the movie 
454	454	negative	i honestly wanted the aliens to win 
455	455	negative	all the characters were just so unlikable 
456	456	negative	just there was only one character the doctor he was the only person i even really cared about 
457	457	negative	and even he was a all of them 
458	458	negative	every single cowboy was just a complete 
459	459	negative	and there was just this little boy and he was the only person who wasnt a 
460	460	negative	but he wasnt even interesting 
461	461	negative	but they gave him no no character like he had no character development whatsoever 
462	462	negative	he was just like a plot device for this other guy to start acting like a father figure and he was just stupid but then he didnt even act like a father figure towards him 
463	463	negative	but he was actually complete 
464	464	negative	why are you killing everyone 
465	465	negative	it just some people were like oh hes so cool hes so awesome like never seen that in the movie this person who had amnesia just kills everybody even if its like but that was so unnecessary 
466	466	negative	what are you killing these people you dont even know whats going on like dude get over yourself 
467	467	postive	he looked awesome while he did it but yeah ok so let all the girls who want all disagree with me coz they all think this is an amazing movie but they all think he was amazing because they were staring at daniel craig the whole time their going oh my gosh hes so hot 
468	468	negative	all the guys that went were pretty much on my page they were just like wow that was stupid wow 
469	469	negative	i sat with the guys and we all try to stay awake through it um and kept falling asleep and then talk about how stupid it was 
470	470	postive	but let me first say this i liked it more than i expected i would 
471	471	postive	this film is slavishly devoted to the original book or nov novella uh by uh charles dickens 
472	472	postive	number one it means its much scarier than you could imagine 
473	473	negative	my 8 year old was terrified through part of this because the original version is terrifying 
474	474	postive	let me say this if your christianity is extremely legalistic this is the film for you 
475	475	negative	cause this is a film that basically says you know what you should do you should take care of poor people because jesus told us to take care of poor people and if you dont take care of poor people youre gonna burn in hell 
476	476	negative	so laughing if thats your form of christianity its a christian film 
477	477	negative	um its not my form 
478	478	negative	um another thing about this film is in its devotion is that sometimes my children could not understand what was being said because they were speaking english 
479	479	negative	sometimes i missed what was being said 
480	480	negative	therefore a lot of social commentary goes woop sound effect over your head 
481	481	negative	or just really doesnt make any difference to us today at all 
482	482	negative	um all this stuff about debtors prison for instance doesnt really um jive here in 21st century america 
483	483	postive	and this film is this amazing like i say slavish devotion to charles dickens with an amusement park ride 
484	484	postive	because this thing is is meant to be seen in 3d 
485	485	postive	and throughout the film youre going sound effects laughing either from the terrifying characters 
486	486	postive	or most likely from going very quickly through london with you know demon horses chasing you so uh theres that 
487	487	negative	also about the animation the people just like in polar express a film i really did not like 
488	488	negative	um the people seemed sort of dead 
489	489	negative	except their eyes are kind of like this welcome to the polar express 
490	490	postive	and thats a lot to be said for a one minute review 
491	491	postive	i actually like the film 
492	492	postive	um i enjoyed myself in it you might as well 
493	493	negative	i would not take a young child 
494	494	postive	nine ninety screening plus i am number four you cant go wrong with that 
495	495	negative	i was not looking forward to see this movie 
496	496	postive	but i went and i dig this movie 
497	497	postive	i was happy to see it 
498	498	postive	plus i had a good time 
499	499	postive	im wanting to talk about the good things about this movie 
500	500	postive	the soundtrack is good its really good some really great songs 
501	501	negative	and the best thing about that is that all two songs um well not all of them but some of the songs are not well well connected with the scenes 
502	502	postive	um anyways the music is good 
503	503	postive	its stuttering that is a good thing 
504	504	postive	i really dig the special effects of this movie 
505	505	postive	like in the middle of the movie it starts with really great action sequences 
506	506	postive	amazing special effects 
507	507	postive	and the ending was really really great too 
508	508	postive	its it was my favorite part of the movie 
509	509	negative	the main problem of this movie is that this movie is so cheesy 
510	510	postive	i mean the blood is like twilight with some scifi with some action and with likable characters and that that is important guys 
511	511	postive	the characters of i am number four are likable 
512	512	neutral	not like the characters of of twilight 
513	513	postive	um the ending is open for a sequel 
514	514	postive	and uh i am looking forward to see a sequel of this movie 
515	515	postive	because i really dig this movie 
516	516	postive	i really dig this movie 
517	517	postive	the picture quality was really great 
518	518	postive	i will even pick up this movie on 
519	519	postive	i will even pick up this movie on um anyways um the movie for me is three starts out of five stars three solid stars 
520	520	postive	cause i had a good time 
521	521	negative	and uh this movie i was not looking forward to see this movie 
522	522	postive	but it was really good 
523	523	postive	the acting is its normal its not bad its not bad at all 
524	524	postive	the likable characters make this movie a really good movie 
525	525	postive	im willing to go with friends alone with family to watch on a rainy day and if you can watch it at half price at a midnight show screening 
526	526	postive	cause its worth it 
527	527	postive	so yeah if you want to have fun this weekend go watch it watch this movie 
528	528	negative	i mean it starts out really slow 
529	529	postive	but overall um go see it 
530	530	postive	it was a cool movie 
531	531	postive	the acting was allright 
532	532	postive	um i thought they casted kind of well 
533	533	negative	but what really threw me off was the dialogue very cheese dialogue 
534	534	negative	oh my god the whole movie had a really dry dialogue 
535	535	postive	there were a couple funny parts 
536	536	negative	but i dont think the humour redeemed the movie from being so bad in the dialogue department 
537	537	negative	whoever wrote this isnt the writer definately 
538	538	postive	but overall i enjoyed it 
539	539	postive	the the whole movie i was you know thinking this isn as bad as ive heard and it wasnt 
540	540	negative	um and the movie was pretty short 
541	541	negative	and the dialogue threw me off 
542	542	postive	other than that um i think it was and ok movie 
543	543	postive	definately a little bit above average 
544	544	postive	i dont think its as bad as you probably read on reviews 
545	545	postive	so yeah go see it 
546	546	postive	um graphics were incredible 
547	547	postive	um some really good acting 
548	548	negative	some really lucky acting 
549	549	postive	so this was pretty funny 
550	550	postive	coz people were like eating popcorn and you see the first show and people you hear like this this ripple effect of whispering oh my god is that a is that am i looking at this right what 
551	551	postive	i thought that was really funny 
552	552	negative	um there could been less blue nudity 
553	553	negative	because what was weird was the fact that in part of the movie hes wearing like a blue um overall long thing medal long thing so i was like why not wear the whole whole time you know why why you got to go command on us 
554	554	postive	it was funny though 
555	555	postive	hes funny 
556	556	negative	its kind of weird 
557	557	postive	i dont know classic superhero kind of getting on kind of thing 
558	558	negative	all right so enough of the nudity 
559	559	negative	um but what sucked what was bad was malin akerman the girl who plays the silk spectre ii 
560	560	negative	um junior lady girl i know i i mean she looked fan fantastic 
561	561	postive	she looked phenomenal 
562	562	postive	she looked like a superhero 
563	563	negative	but she acted like power ranger 
564	564	negative	and theres a vast difference between those two things 
565	565	postive	ill tell you who made the movie 
566	566	postive	who was just kick ass 100 of time was the guy that played our rorschach 
567	567	postive	but anyways he was awesome 
568	568	postive	i thought that was very cool 
569	569	postive	um he was awesome 
570	570	postive	like he was incredible 
571	571	postive	the other guy that did a really good job was um jeffrey dean morgan 
572	572	postive	he did a very good job 
573	573	negative	very dark 
574	574	negative	um i really liked sicko guy 
575	575	postive	but um he did a really good job at acting 
576	576	postive	i was very impressed 
577	577	postive	so overall its its like a blend of got alternative history 
578	578	postive	and its very very interesting 
579	579	negative	um but its extremely dark 
580	580	negative	i warn you its a very very dark 
581	581	negative	and um theres not in my opinion there wasnt very much of a balance between sort of like the good evil kind of thing 
582	582	negative	and it seemed like everything was sort of overwhelmingly bad 
583	583	negative	um so at the end theres not really a whole lot of redeeming value that i think you come up with 
584	584	postive	but um you know overall it was good 
585	585	neutral	um ronny wanted to know what was the last movie we saw in theatres and to give a review for it 
586	586	negative	um i think the last movie i saw in theatres was toy story 3 and i hated it 
587	587	postive	i really did 
588	588	negative	i think im getting to that point where im just not entertained by disney pixar movies anymore because i couldnt stand up 
589	589	negative	and i really hated cars 
590	590	postive	i liked finding nemo 
591	591	postive	and i liked wally 
592	592	negative	i didnt think it was funny 
593	593	negative	i didnt think it was cute 
594	594	negative	i didnt think it was sad 
595	595	negative	i just hated it 
596	596	negative	like seriously 
597	597	negative	two out of five stars 
598	598	negative	i guess im just over it 
599	599	postive	i kind of have a um artistic video up on my main channel 
600	600	postive	i love you guys 
601	601	postive	who have named themselves after the places um to which they have traveled in which i think is a really nice xxx 
602	602	neutral	now columbus is a basically um ocd 
603	603	postive	the um cross of personality is really um charismatic and dynamic 
604	604	negative	um it just goes to show that you really cant trust anyone in this situation 
605	605	postive	zombieland is a really sucessful horror comedy 
606	606	postive	as it contains um rea really well done and faithful homages to the zombie horror sub genre 
607	607	postive	and um while also maintains its kind of detached um satire of the genre 
608	608	postive	but its really well done 
609	609	postive	because um you really wanna see it for yourself 
610	610	postive	um its basically a um slow motion show case of different events 
611	611	postive	this credit sequence i think is the best credit sequence um since watchman 
612	612	postive	and i honestly think if we have seen watchman this would be the best credit sequence of the year 
613	613	postive	yeah it really is good i mean 
614	614	postive	it uses um and this just doesnt apply to the um um credit se sequence on it own but applies to the movie as a whole it really knows how to use s slow motion without making it a gimmick 
615	615	postive	the sequences of the beginning of the film which features columbus explaining some of his rules um to surviving a zombie apocalypse are really well done 
616	616	postive	the xxx sequence is really well done 
617	617	postive	but its a very kind of um stylistic edge on it 
618	618	postive	it its almost like um imagining tarantino directed a zombie movie 
619	619	postive	and the style of the film like the um the free streams of slow motion the um the jump cooks and all that stuff feels very kind of um tarantino ask 
620	620	negative	i cant express my thoughts and feelings about this movie adequately without describing some specific things in the third act of the movie 
621	621	postive	it was widely believed that a sucess of green lantern movie would lead warner brothers to adapt the flash and wonder woman among possibly others 
622	622	postive	and put them in a justice leage movie with the ritual batman and superman 
623	623	negative	so not only that this movie have to deal with the burden of telling its own story and setting up its own inevitable sequels 
624	624	negative	it had to deal with the expectations of potentially setting up all that others stuff 
625	625	negative	yeah not good 
626	626	negative	to all the green lantern fans out there i am so sorry 
627	627	negative	i say that for two reasons first because someone owes you an apologize 
628	628	negative	and warner brothers is never gonna give you one 
629	629	negative	and secondly because as a marvell geek i have experienced my fair share of disappointments over the last decade and i can genuinely sympathize with you 
630	630	postive	before i get to the negatives of the movie let me list off a few of the positives 
631	631	postive	i love jeffrey rush and michael clarke duncan as the voice actors 
632	632	postive	they do a great job with their roles 
633	633	postive	they are great additions 
634	634	postive	i also love the casting of mark strong as sinestro 
635	635	postive	hes perfect for that role 
636	636	postive	and um finally a particular stand out scene for me was the fighter jet sequence 
637	637	postive	it was by far my favorite action seen in the movie 
638	638	postive	i thought it was really well put together 
639	639	postive	and um i thought it worked worked pretty well 
640	640	negative	um and in fact in spite of all the negatives im about to mention i thought the movie was working for a while for about the first third um but at the end of act one two significant things happened 
641	641	negative	actor human arrives and starts chewing scenery like its a two dollar steak 
642	642	negative	and how jordan flies off to the green lantern core planet oh and the movie starts sequel baiting 
643	643	negative	these two developments together caused what was up to that point a noble effort to start falling apart at the seams 
644	644	negative	and it was painful to watch 
645	645	negative	i dont even know why i really should begin with listing off the negatives but im going to start with a few of the superficial things 
646	646	negative	the acting ranges from mediocrity to from the live action actors 
647	647	negative	but i cant really blame them for that 
648	648	negative	this is star wars prequel territory 
649	649	negative	the acting is not that bad 
650	650	negative	but still its that kind of movie making 
651	651	postive	uh i really enjoyed doing them for the philly d movie club so i thought oh why not 
652	652	postive	uh rango is a really cute movie 
653	653	postive	um i i liked a lot of the movie 
654	654	postive	i will admit im a big johnny depp fan 
655	655	postive	um i pretty much will go see any movie that kind of has an interesting plot if hes in it 
656	656	negative	um its not his best 
657	657	postive	i mean corpse bride hes really good in corpse bride 
658	658	neutral	and rango kind of falls into that 
659	659	postive	well its a johnny depp movie so its entertaining 
660	660	negative	but its not something that i would go buy 
661	661	negative	or something i would recommend 
662	662	postive	unless you have little kids to bring with you 
663	663	postive	oh it has some really good references of past johnny depp films in it like while the chameleons getting bounced along the highway you run into henry s thompson 
664	664	postive	uh hes super entertaining as the chameleon 
665	665	postive	i mean johnny depts a wonderful voice actor so um he hes i do hes an incredible voice actor 
666	666	postive	like thats really the best part of the movie is listening to him uh pull off all these different voices 
667	667	postive	and be this really quirky little chameleon 
668	668	postive	um i i would yeah i would recommend it if you have little kids 
669	669	negative	but if you dont really have any small friends uh that sounded really perverted small children that you are related to um to take to the movies uh i wouldnt go see it by myself 
670	670	neutral	i definitely will buy it 
671	671	postive	but uh it was worth the free movie passes that i used on it 
672	672	postive	and thanks for listening to me ramble 
673	673	negative	it only had the potential to be a film that was both proving and action packed 
674	674	negative	but unfortunately its just an ugly wild violent involving and sadistic exercise 
675	675	negative	that i got very little joy out of 
676	676	negative	in fact i got mostly pain out of it 
677	677	neutral	thats pretty heavily inferred in the opening sequence 
678	678	negative	when she gets there is forced to not only be trapped in the vocation that she obviously doesnt wanna be in 
679	679	negative	now it also takes so really creepy xxx the fact that emily browning in this movie looks like shes underage 
680	680	negative	but i dont know 
681	681	negative	that kind of looks like video game in a certain way 
682	682	neutral	in fact the first time she goes in it looks like a japanese temple 
683	683	negative	and later time she goes like a world war ii battlefield um castle this kind of pulled out of lord of the rings 
684	684	neutral	whats in her mind within her mind in a way its kind of like inception in that way 
685	685	postive	its kind of playing with the idea whats real whats not what the matrix films did 
686	686	neutral	although actually the best comparison this is this film would actually be something like pans labyrinth 
687	687	negative	cowboys and aliens metaphorical speaking is like one of those nfl teams that has the talent to be a super bowl champion but instead ends up being a wild cart team that just gets dismissed in the first round of playoffs 
688	688	postive	yeah job pretty well done 
689	689	negative	i mean it wasnt a bad year 
690	690	neutral	but there was a lot of potential left on the table 
691	691	neutral	and that describes cowboys and aliens pretty well 
692	692	postive	though i guess i should be grateful that it turned out as good as it did 
693	693	postive	because given all the strikes that it had going against before wonder production it could have been much much worse 
694	694	postive	fortunately some good decisions were made before the camara started rolling 
695	695	negative	but this probably had the unfortunate side effect of raising bad expectations to unreasonable levels 
696	696	postive	when i saw the first trailer back in november of last year this movie immediately shot up near the top of my list of must see movies for 2011 
697	697	negative	the final product ultimately doesnt live up to the high order of that first trailer 
698	698	postive	but its still a pretty enjoyable ride if you go in wanting to see a bunch of cowboys battle a bunch of aliens yeah youll pretty much get your fill 
699	699	postive	but if thats all youre looking for youll actually miss the best thing about this movie 
700	700	negative	jon favreau is probably not the guy that i would hire if i was looking for a director for an action movie 
701	701	negative	i mean yeah hes a competent action director 
702	702	neutral	hes action sequences are certainly a lot better than the incoherent impossible to follow slope that we see in a typical michael bay movie 
703	703	negative	but its action isnt particulary memorable 
704	704	negative	and the action wasnt the most memorable thing about any on those movies 
705	705	postive	the ironman films are fondly remembered mostly for robert down jr not the action 
706	706	negative	and the same thing has more or less happened here yeah thats right 
707	707	postive	the movie called cowboys and aliens daniel craig steels the whole damn show 
708	708	postive	hes playing a variation of the iconic man with no name character that was made famous by clint eastwood 
709	709	postive	and now that ive seen him in the role i cant imagine any other current actor trying ot pull it off 
710	710	postive	he is perfect from start to finish 
711	711	postive	harrison ford is a long for the ride and having a blast as the second lead 
712	712	postive	and the cast is pretty well rounded out with supporting performance from guys like sam rockwell as the doc 
713	713	negative	theyre all playing cliched stock western characters 
714	714	postive	but i really dont care that the characters are walking cliches when they are this well done 
715	715	postive	and the actors do such a good job of carrying of their particular arcs 
716	716	negative	cowboys and aliens problem is the screenplay 
717	717	negative	six different people got writing credit for this movie and the results are exactly what you would expect 
718	718	postive	not great 
719	719	negative	sigh i really think what this was missing was that humor and that wit that than the other shrek movies 
720	720	negative	um its just not there 
721	721	postive	its okay 
722	722	negative	but its really not wonderful 
723	723	negative	nothing to rush out and see 
724	724	neutral	there arent a lot of kids movies out right now so 
725	725	neutral	and i guess normally shrek is for adults 
726	726	negative	but lack you know very lackluster 
727	727	negative	chuckle be forewarned low expectations 
728	728	postive	okay and now its late 
729	729	negative	which would have been a better name for the movie 
730	730	postive	and i really enjoyed it 
731	731	postive	the countryside which they showed while going across ireland was astoundingly ble beautiful 
732	732	postive	and in the scene with the destroyed castle it really reminded me why i want to go there so badly 
733	733	postive	although i enjoyed the movie 
734	734	negative	if i think about it honestly the plot wasnt that great 
735	735	postive	its a fun chick flick 
736	736	negative	but other than that it doesnt really hold up under inspection 
737	737	negative	lip smacking all the problems that come to stop them from getting to their destination are although plausible a little weak 
738	738	negative	even though the whole movie is based on whether she gets to dublin in time youre never really worried about it because you know she gets there 
739	739	postive	lip making a lot of this movie brings a cute laugh here and there 
740	740	postive	and both the actors amy adams and matthew goode work well with each other 
741	741	postive	and seem to be really enjoying themselves the whole way through 
742	742	negative	even when theyre fighting in the movie though it just seems like its their banter not actual dislike 
743	743	postive	all in all if youre looking for a cute romantic comedy with a beautiful setting then this will probably be a good movie for you 
744	744	postive	i just got finished watching an excellent movie called mars needs moms 
745	745	postive	and my favorite characters in the movie would have to be milo milos mother and gribble 
746	746	postive	i liked gribble because he helped milo get milos mother away from the alias 
747	747	postive	which i thought was awesome 
748	748	postive	and my favorite part in the movie was when milo has to save gribble 
749	749	postive	and i would recommend this movie for ages 3 and up 
750	750	postive	because it is a good movie 
751	751	postive	and it depends what age you are and how you to how you feel like see the movie 
752	752	negative	like for example my brother is five years old and he didnt think this movie was scary at all 
753	753	postive	i am eight years old and i thought it was really s kind of scary 
754	754	negative	and i think i why i would be scared is because i would feel scared and kind of sad if i lost my own mother 
755	755	postive	but it all turns out great in the end 
756	756	neutral	and he really seems to be channeling michael bay in this movie 
757	757	negative	the plot has the consistency of swiss cheese 
758	758	postive	and its really glossed over with lots of stunning special effects and big explosions 
759	759	negative	sigh all in all its kind of a disappointment to any of us who grew up in the 80s and are used to the toys in the cartoon 
760	760	negative	i feel like it almost should have had a g rating 
761	761	negative	it was really kind of dumb down for us 
762	762	negative	and i hate to say that 
763	763	postive	i think you will really love this movie if you are 8 
764	764	negative	but if you are a child who grew up in that time period youre not going to enjoy this movie very much 
765	765	negative	because they arent playing to you theyre playing to a new audience of kids who dont know anything about these characters in the first place 
766	766	neutral	and all i can is hes a pretty average guy 
767	767	negative	i dont really feel any emotional pull from him in this movie 
768	768	negative	marlon wayans kind of plays a watered down version of himself from other movies 
769	769	postive	he does some stereotypical things like talking uh about busting a cap while flying an airplane 
770	770	negative	and hes pretty average too 
771	771	postive	the two women in this movie are particularly good looking 
772	772	postive	and so thats pretty entertaining 
773	773	postive	this is a really big movie for their careers because i havent really seen them in a lot of big movies 
774	774	negative	and his performance is campy and comes off as an army cheerleader some of the time 
775	775	postive	he is average 
776	776	negative	and its sh so short lived he barely needs to even be there 
777	777	postive	uh is very cool 
778	778	postive	his fight sequences are very neat 
779	779	postive	and he delivers a lot of intensity 
780	780	negative	robin hood starring russel crow um first thing i got to say xxx i was dreading going in to see this movie 
781	781	negative	the trailers weren really doing it much for me 
782	782	negative	so i really was not looking forward to seeing this movie 
783	783	negative	um but i guess say maybe my expectations were lowered by these other reviews that i read 
784	784	postive	but i didnt mind it 
785	785	neutral	but i didnt find it all that bad 
786	786	negative	i didnt find it all that good 
787	787	postive	like i said maybe my expectations were lowered because of all of those reviews but i really didnt hate it 
788	788	negative	like what people could hate about this movie there are some negatives to say the least 
789	789	negative	um really first and foremost it just lacked the charm of these past robin hood movies that we know 
790	790	postive	theres men in tights which you know hilarious spoof of the story 
791	791	negative	theres a kevin costner prince of fee version which was supposed to be the dark and edgy version of his time i mean but that was what thirteen years ago fourteen years ago probably more than that 
792	792	negative	and it just lacked the charm of those past movies 
793	793	negative	it did seem to focus too much on epic epic epic 
794	794	negative	and it really just lacked what made the other movies more enjoyable 
795	795	negative	and suffers from what i call kingdom of heaven syndrome where it builds too much for these huge catastrophic war sequences theyre supposed to blow you away but the problem is you dont give a damn because it just lacks that charm of the past movies 
796	796	negative	um not in all instances but the ones that matter the most yeah 
797	797	negative	um russel crow and cate blanchette just did not sell it for me i had a very hard time just buying it 
798	798	negative	like were supposed to believe that these two are in their mid wel you know mid thirties at the oldest and laughter theyre looking pretty rough in this movie 
799	799	postive	i can appreciate that 
800	800	negative	hes not gonna be looking like a chipper bright young man but early thirties really you want me to buy that 
801	801	negative	i cant do it 
802	802	negative	especially when hes hanging around with a married men who all but one of them are probably early twenties laughter and one of them is maybe mid twenties and meanwhile theyre hanging in with papa russel it just looks like you know its bunch of a guys hanging there so one brought dad along coz he offered to drive 
803	803	negative	and um i have to admit i was watching this i purposely put it on because i figured it would be something that would be stupid that i could fall asleep in the middle of and not miss too much 
804	804	negative	just wanted something to watch while i was falling asleep 
805	805	negative	so i didnt didnt have very high expectations for this movie 
806	806	negative	and i um pretty much it pretty much met my low expectations for the most part 
807	807	negative	because i three major complaints i have about this movie 
808	808	negative	um biggest one is the cgi effects were just terrible 
809	809	negative	and um the story was pretty weird 
810	810	negative	um and again i i if i had to pay closer attention i might have followed it more 
811	811	negative	and might have been it might have made more sense 
812	812	negative	um um this movie this movie um by half way through i was checking the time and saw that this movie was two hours long 
813	813	negative	which i mean for a movie about ji joe ninth minutes is enough 
814	814	negative	ok i dont need a three hour mini xxx about ji joe 
815	815	negative	but thats just me 
816	816	negative	i thought that two hours was way too long for this movie 
817	817	negative	and the last big thing was um just the the it it i know its about joe you know obviously its gonna be about the army but it just felt like um like um military propaganda kind of like you know 
818	818	negative	it fell like i was watching one of those army of one commercials sometimes 
819	819	negative	of course its too much 
820	820	postive	of course its gonna be making them look good just fine 
821	821	postive	i i guess um but the funny thing is um i mean funny thing is despite as despite everything bad about this movie i ended up half way liking it 
822	822	negative	and thats because about half way through the movie i realized that this is just its really just a cartoon 
823	823	negative	if you look at it as a live action movie you youre gonna be disappointed 
824	824	negative	but if you look at it as a cartoon which is pretty much mostly is with all the cgi fx 
825	825	negative	and and there is a lot of it 
826	826	neutral	i mean this movie makes um makes um star wars pretty close 
827	827	postive	i mean its its about that level star war is 
828	828	negative	pretty close as far as just cgi heavy like this time its what its like human face and everything around that face is cartoon cgi computer effects 
829	829	negative	before i went in to see the green lantern ive been hearing all these like critics basically just trashing this movie left and right 
830	830	postive	but i at the same time i do wanna just say that i enjoyed this movie 
831	831	postive	i enjoyed it for what it was you know 
832	832	postive	its a huge sort of spectacle movie that is great for this summer time you know 
833	833	postive	this is a movie that youre gonna go out and see 
834	834	postive	and you wanna see it in 3d 
835	835	postive	because i i would actually say this probably is one of the first movies this year that ive seen this year that you wanna see in 3d especially for just the opening portion 
836	836	postive	it looks really good 
837	837	postive	and the rest of it does look good as well 
838	838	postive	and i just had fun watching this movie 
839	839	postive	its not like a dark movie or anything 
840	840	postive	its very much a light hearted 
841	841	postive	so its perfect for kids as well as just like teenagers as well who just wanna see a lot of explosions and some crazy stuff 
842	842	negative	and you know going into it or these watching the trailers before head i was really kind of hesitant about seeing the green lantern in the first place 
843	843	negative	because it looks like a cartoon 
844	844	negative	im not really a huge fan of having like all these 3d characters 
845	845	negative	because i think why not just make this you know movie this live action movie and talk cartoon 
846	846	postive	thats really the route that youre gonna go 
847	847	neutral	and it seemed like they were gonna go that route 
848	848	postive	but i think there was also some sort of like um tone within the actual um powers of the green lantern and himself and that you can basically think up of anything and you can project that into the real life 
849	849	postive	and i think having this sort of superpower almost this power to just imagine anything kind of just um helped me get passed that you know these are all cgi characters and set 
850	850	postive	this is a playground and their imaginary playground and anything can happen anything that what also made the film exciting 
851	851	postive	because you dont entirely know whats coming next 
852	852	negative	but then you kind of like walk out of the movie and youre like well i i get what happened i understand what happened 
853	853	negative	but what what would you do for green lantern movie 2 that would be even like worth while now 
854	854	neutral	because i mean if hes able to do all of this sort of stuff like how youre supposed to really put up a force that can push him to the next level or or destroy him at the same time 
855	855	postive	and it does kind of a lea helps alleviate what that whole was is about fighting the ultimate enemy within this first movie and that the threat is still there potentially speaking 
856	856	postive	so its kind of interesting to see um where theyre gonna be going with that 
857	857	postive	im looking forward to it ive got to say 
858	858	negative	its not like the green lantern is the next batman begins or or the dark nighter 
859	859	neutral	but i do wanna tell you about priest 
860	860	negative	if you were looking for a movie that has anything realistic in it you should not be looking at this movie because it is insane 
861	861	postive	if you like explosions really ridiculous action sequences melodramatic plot and acting this is the right movie to see 
862	862	postive	and she also has pretty sweet moves 
863	863	postive	and is fun to watch 
864	864	postive	some really fun touches within the movie is that two vampires in other shows appear in this movie not as vampires 
865	865	postive	there also two lord of the rings grads which i absolutely love 
866	866	postive	and anyone who knows me knows the lord of the rings trilogy is probably my favorite movie ever 
867	867	negative	if all three of them were put together 
868	868	postive	yeah thats about how my favorite list goes 
869	869	negative	which basically means hes wormtongue again in a different way 
870	870	postive	other notable mentioned are christopher plumber 
871	871	postive	and she is a really pretty girl 
872	872	postive	this is one of my favorite types of movies 
873	873	postive	i really love the melodramatic over the top crazy action sort of thing going on 
874	874	postive	theres s scene in a cave where they fight a giant monster that really reminds me of like some sort of lord of the rings mines of moria moment 
875	875	postive	and theres a better on top of the train fights than the first mission impossible movie 
876	876	postive	so yes i really enjoyed it 
877	877	postive	i thought it was fun 
878	878	postive	and i enjoyed myself a lot at the movie 
879	879	postive	i laughed at quite a bit of the dialogue 
880	880	postive	and there actually was one scene that i found kin 
881	881	negative	watch this fucking movie 
882	882	postive	and um particularly the movies that i feel like should gotten nominated but didnt and never let me go is actually one of those movies 
883	883	negative	i think a lot of people are really split about this movie 
884	884	negative	theres a certain deadpan nature to it 
885	885	negative	it was a pretty slow movie for the most part 
886	886	postive	and it was it was thoughtful 
887	887	negative	but there are you know there critics of movies that are sometimes too thoughtful in a way and i think that would never let me go 
888	888	negative	a lot of critics said that it relied too much on the audience to um explore the themes in the film and you know tightly so i guess which 
889	889	postive	um in a way a lot of the themes in never let me go which were very profound and deep 
890	890	negative	they weren fully explored 
891	891	neutral	and i think that the movie did rely on you to kind of figure it out and kind of deal with those ideas by yourself 
892	892	postive	but regardless i thought it was a very good movie 
893	893	postive	those three are some of the best young actors of today 
894	894	postive	she and everything she does she has so much grace to it and so much fluidity 
895	895	negative	and keira knightley i mean everybody knows her from the pirates of the carribean 
896	896	postive	but i mean in her other works like pride and prejudice shes just been realy fantastic 
897	897	neutral	and andrew garfield of course everybody knows him form the social network 
898	898	postive	so look out for that that should be interesting 
899	899	postive	but anyways they did um they did act very well 
900	900	negative	and you dont exactly know what is going on 
901	901	neutral	i think it takes place sometime um its i dont think its present day 
902	902	postive	but its um its someone modern i would say 
903	903	postive	its not its not like a period piece or anything 
904	904	negative	and you dont exactly know whats going on 
905	905	negative	and i think early on the twist is revealed 
906	906	postive	because i really wanted to see it actually 
907	907	negative	and um first of all i i actually was never a huge fan of the ji joe tv series 
908	908	neutral	or big collector of the action figures 
909	909	postive	but i wasnt big on it um 
910	910	postive	ji joe rise of the cobra um this movie is incredible cheese 
911	911	postive	but in the good way i in ist theres two types of cheese and this is the good kind of cheese 
912	912	negative	yes it the acting is a little rough in some parts 
913	913	negative	well you know um corny 
914	914	negative	but the m the script is corny 
915	915	negative	i mean the way its written is corny 
916	916	postive	i mean i didnt go to this movie expecting to see the dark night 
917	917	postive	and quite honestly i wish ive seen this over the summer 
918	918	postive	because if ive seen it over the summer i probably would rated it best action movie i saw this summer 
919	919	negative	this summer was kind of weird with the action movies if you ask me 
920	920	postive	i did like transformers 2 even though a lot of people didnt like that 
921	921	negative	but you know this movie um this really um would made up for a disappointment that it had a terminator salvation 
922	922	postive	and um you know you have a lot of good actors in this movie actually a lot of good actors 
923	923	negative	in you know theyre in there this is a cheese um movie 
924	924	negative	so you know its not like you actually getting like academy award quality acting performances 
925	925	negative	um and now the performances are like something like to write home about 
926	926	postive	um that being said you can tell that lot people were having fun with this 
927	927	postive	and i xxx like in particular joseph joseph had a lot of fun with his role 
928	928	postive	i think um rachel nichols had a lot of fun with her role 
929	929	postive	marlon wayans had a lot of fun 
930	930	postive	but the guy from lost had a lot of fun 
931	931	postive	dennis quaid i think had a lot of fun 
932	932	neutral	um same with christopher eccleston 
933	933	postive	so i i think it was cool to actually see ray park in action great action star 
934	934	postive	he does a great job with his snake eyes which is always cool to see that 
935	935	postive	joe movie is how international it was it was very divert 
936	936	negative	and i thought this movie was gonna be really good because matt damon was in it 
937	937	negative	and i was really disappointed 
938	938	negative	like they talk for like five minutes and instantly kiss which is dumb 
939	939	postive	what i liked about this movie was the concept was cool 
940	940	negative	but they did not execute it very well 
941	941	negative	and they left a lot of plot holes 
942	942	negative	this movie is terrible for these reasons 
943	943	negative	number one because the love is forced 
944	944	negative	you dont feel that these two people love each other 
945	945	negative	and it is very rushed 
946	946	negative	i mean you dont see why these two people love each other 
947	947	negative	theres no character development really with these two 
948	948	negative	like they have their own separate character development but none where these two should be together 
949	949	negative	theres no reason why they should be together 
950	950	negative	you dont see why they should like each other cause they dont show it in the movie 
951	951	negative	browning is mediocre role 
952	952	negative	theres never a feeling of star quality with her 
953	953	negative	she isnt terrible 
954	954	negative	but quite frankly she is implausible 
955	955	neutral	like the average horror film the uninvited 
956	956	postive	and visually stunning 
957	957	postive	and i dont know why people are hating on the film because i really do love it 
958	958	negative	overall browning is just fails to deliver 
959	959	negative	and is upstaged by many other performances in the film 
960	960	negative	the supporting cast is either hit or miss 
961	961	postive	the hits include oscar isaak as the main villain like i said blue jena malone is the soft spoken rocket and the stealing abby cornish is sweet pea a troubled and reluctant young woman in the pack 
962	962	negative	the misses include you know vanessa hudgens 
963	963	negative	who doesnt have any presents or greatness at all 
964	964	negative	and the other horrible i mean absolutely atrocious carla gugino as doctor vera gorski 
965	965	negative	whos accent is so awful 
966	966	negative	and whos is ridiculous 
967	967	negative	and her character is also undeveloped and weak 
968	968	postive	jon hamm and scott glenn could bring you know they could be interesting characters 
969	969	negative	and they could have great back stories 
970	970	negative	but they you know they they bring nothing to this table 
971	971	negative	and which hurts the film drastically 
972	972	postive	because they are interesting characters 
973	973	postive	and could have interesting back stories 
974	974	negative	the acting could be better and is very medio 
975	975	postive	there is some sort of greatness to sucker punch though 
976	976	postive	first the visual effects here are stellar 
977	977	postive	they are unique 
978	978	postive	incredible candy 
979	979	postive	and just overall superb 
980	980	postive	and the action in the movie is so well used 
981	981	negative	which i was not excited to see 
982	982	postive	and it actually surprised me 
983	983	postive	and i have to admit i i like shrek i do 
984	984	postive	i like the first two shares quite a bit 
985	985	negative	um theyre become quite a bit overrated 
986	986	postive	but the first two were pretty excellent 
987	987	negative	the third one was a piece of crap 
988	988	negative	and thats why i was not excited about the fourth one 
989	989	postive	um which actually was really good 
990	990	postive	i did like the fourth one quite a bit 
991	991	postive	um i i did enjoy it 
992	992	postive	it reminded me of the first one had the same kind of vibe like the first one 
993	993	postive	and it just was better 
994	994	negative	maybe its the baby ogres maybe bringing in the baby ogres really brought it down 
995	995	negative	coz the first two were great and they brought in the kids and it made it more kiddy friendly movie 
996	996	postive	the first two were kid movies 
997	997	postive	but they were had adult humour 
998	998	postive	i though that adults would appreciate 
999	999	negative	and would go over the kids heads and this is what the fourth one kind of has 
1000	1000	postive	the third one was more kid humour though 
1001	1001	negative	it didnt have that much adult humour in it 
1002	1002	postive	um yeah the fourth one it does have kid humour definately 
1003	1003	negative	its a kids movie 
1004	1004	postive	but it does have some adult humour 
1005	1005	negative	those are quote in this movie that sounded so dirty coming out 
1006	1006	postive	but it as great 
1007	1007	negative	yes um something about waffle hole am i the only one am i perverted not to think that that sounds dirty coz it totally does waffle hole 
1008	1008	postive	it had me laughing out loud 
1009	1009	negative	and i dont think that many other people were laughing about it 
1010	1010	postive	um yeah its its better than the third one absolutely 
1011	1011	negative	because my one of my cousins doesnt like the glasses 
1012	1012	postive	and let me tell you it surpassed itself 
1013	1013	negative	it reached the new rights of horrendous 
1014	1014	negative	this movie isnt just bad its diabolical 
1015	1015	negative	first let me just say i saw quite a few guys at the cinema who clearly been dragged there by the girlfriends and to those guys i say would you like me to sew your balls back on for you 
1016	1016	negative	also if youre a streight man and you voluntarily willingly goo and see this film im gonna need you to light a candle say a prayer and ask yourself some questions 
1017	1017	neutral	this is really just a continuation of the first film 
1018	1018	negative	where the problem with that lies not entirely sure 
1019	1019	negative	let me see if i can rustle up some symphony yeah ive got nothing 
1020	1020	negative	i dont know if charlotte started on made me never want to have kids or never want to have rich friends 
1021	1021	postive	miranda miranda was always one of the best characters 
1022	1022	postive	this movie is adorable 
1023	1023	postive	this movie is just too adorable 
1024	1024	postive	there were some really good things about this movie 
1025	1025	postive	the voice acting excellent 
1026	1026	postive	the visuals were great 
1027	1027	postive	this was probably the best 3d movie ive seen in a long time coz it actually used 3d 
1028	1028	postive	toy story had elements of it but this movie played with 3d and um different ways to come at you out of the screen 
1029	1029	postive	so i liked that a lot 
1030	1030	postive	the voice acting in this was incredible 
1031	1031	postive	steve carell voices gru and russell brand actually really impressed me with his old man voice for the doctor 
1032	1032	postive	of i couldnt i couldnt even believe it was russell brand 
1033	1033	postive	i kept i was listening bored 
1034	1034	negative	and there was maybe one time when i thought i actually heard russell brand himself 
1035	1035	postive	but otherwise i thought he was excellent 
1036	1036	postive	as for 3d i say yes 
1037	1037	postive	theres one scene in this movie that makes 3d entirely worth it 
1038	1038	postive	and some people might think that theres a lot of cheap tricks 
1039	1039	postive	but theres a roller coaster scene and if you are um get a little bit motion sick you might not wanna see it in 3d because youll feel like youre on this coaster 
1040	1040	postive	i mean my stomach was almost going work as we went down the big drop 
1041	1041	postive	i thought it was really cool 
1042	1042	postive	that was a great effect 
1043	1043	negative	there was a lot of cheap child humour 
1044	1044	postive	which everyone can relate to 
1045	1045	postive	and i i always think thats hilarious 
1046	1046	postive	but what made this movie really fun was some of the adult humour jabs 
1047	1047	neutral	what can i say im just curious 
1048	1048	negative	dont get me wrong kate hudson is is pretty fine looking but i just think its kind of stupid everyone says has a fat ass 
1049	1049	negative	yes she has a fat ass in terms of white girls but her ass isnt really that fat 
1050	1050	negative	first of all the movie was boring 
1051	1051	negative	i mean the movie really wasnt funny at all 
1052	1052	negative	all the all the funny parts weren funny 
1053	1053	negative	i mean the movie was i guess it was a waste of time 
1054	1054	negative	i wa hey she might like it but even then its not really funny at all 
1055	1055	negative	anne hathaway is really over rated in my opinion 
1056	1056	negative	i mean her acting is like so so and i cant believe she even won a oscar beleive she won an oscar or for best supporting actress or best actress something 
1057	1057	negative	i mean that movie was a waste of time 
1058	1058	negative	its two girls trying too hard 
1059	1059	negative	and it just really wasnt good 
1060	1060	postive	which is where all great relationships should start 
1061	1061	negative	and just its very its very chaotic at the end of this movie 
1062	1062	negative	i literally said out loud what que what is this movie that i am seeing what is this 
1063	1063	negative	i do not understand this movie 
1064	1064	negative	but theres a reason for that theres a reason for why i was confused 
1065	1065	negative	first off the commercial makes the terrible terrible mistake of saying that it is more thought provoking than inception 
1066	1066	negative	thanks a lot commercial 
1067	1067	negative	the entire time i was constantly comparing it to inception 
1068	1068	postive	but i must say those are some pretty big shoes to fill so i thought maybe it has a chance 
1069	1069	postive	i i should give it a shot you know 
1070	1070	negative	i was just waiting for joseph gordon levitt to come out just jump out any time and say its a paradox 
1071	1071	negative	now the only part that i found in the first thirty minutes of the movie was when matt damon first discovers the bureau in the first place 
1072	1072	negative	which kind of just ruins the suspense right there because if got some convenient guy in a fedora to just tell you oh yes we are the adjustment bureau and this is what we do you know its just kind of ruins the suspense 
1073	1073	negative	and now im not im not excited anymore 
1074	1074	neutral	interestingly it turned out to be more of a romantic comedy than it was a thriller 
1075	1075	postive	um you know it had some interesting writing 
1076	1076	postive	you know it was it was funny at times 
1077	1077	postive	matt damon is a you know hes a pretty funny guy 
1078	1078	negative	but just aside from that they really dropped the ball on the parts 
1079	1079	negative	overall overall it had far too many plot holes 
1080	1080	negative	and just not enough depth to be interesting 
1081	1081	postive	i have to say my favorite character in the entire movie is the character thompson 
1082	1082	negative	but hes just the creepiest old guy youll ever see in your life he stands over people when theyre asleep just staring at them 
1083	1083	postive	yes when you hear johnny depp you think uh this movie has to be good 
1084	1084	negative	im not going to lie to you it wasnt good 
1085	1085	negative	it was really boring to me 
1086	1086	negative	chuckling i mean and i dont actually go and im not being biased because i dont really go for the animated type films 
1087	1087	negative	i go for like the more oldies type type films i guess like the older pixar films like toy story and all that stuff 
1088	1088	negative	um but this one was uh i dont know i mean the story was there but sigh i dont know 
1089	1089	negative	laughing you know a movies terrible when a person trying to review it doesnt even know what to say but i dont know this movie was 
1090	1090	postive	uh johnny depp doing the voice was fantastic 
1091	1091	negative	but it was just it was like im not gonna even lie to you guys i fell asleep around the middle of it and woke up like what just happened 
1092	1092	negative	um its one of those movies where most of the funny parts are in the commercial you know seen the commercial so many times that that part isnt even funny anymore and then youre wondering where the hell is the rest of it 
1093	1093	negative	it wasnt there 
1094	1094	negative	it just wasnt it di did not work for me 
1095	1095	postive	the voice acting was phenomenal 
1096	1096	negative	but the the actual story line was just terrible 
1097	1097	negative	it was so bad i just did not enjoy it 
1098	1098	postive	uh i will i will actually say this right now it was a good waste of like 12 
1099	1099	negative	im not even kidding i went with a bunch of friends and a movies supposed to be ten times better when youre with a bunch of friends 
1100	1100	negative	and uh my friend next to me fell asleep 
1101	1101	negative	and the two others were just bored 
1102	1102	negative	um yeah so we were out for most of it we were talking about i was texting i just like i had absolutely the film had no draw to me 
1103	1103	postive	the beginning started off great with a couple good jokes 
1104	1104	postive	and really funny uh animation stuff it was great really funny 
1105	1105	negative	um and then towards the middle it was like what is going on 
1106	1106	negative	like i dont understand 
1107	1107	negative	like i i actually felt myself checking the time cuz i was like when is this movie going to end 
1108	1108	negative	i do not wanna see any more of this 
1109	1109	negative	and i tell i couldnt get out of that movie theatre fast enough 
1110	1110	postive	um in general um the little kids seemed to like it that were in there 
1111	1111	negative	but the adults were the adults that were actually attempting to watch it and the people who were my age as well were like what did i just see 
1112	1112	negative	i uh jesus i dont know it was sigh its sad though because i expected so much mo 
1113	1113	postive	i always like to read the book first 
1114	1114	negative	its a weird thing 
1115	1115	postive	because priscilla from the readable gave a such a good review 
1116	1116	postive	um i suggest that you guys go and watch this movie 
1117	1117	postive	it was so good 
1118	1118	postive	um its surpassed my expectations 
1119	1119	negative	um usually im not really a big huge scifi alien kind of fan 
1120	1120	postive	but um it was really really good 
1121	1121	postive	um i really wanna go read the book now 
1122	1122	negative	coz im so curious to see um how the storyline um got to that point 
1123	1123	negative	i heard that in the book it describes um the plan of the glory a lot better 
1124	1124	postive	um gives more details so i cant wait to get my hands on it now 
1125	1125	postive	um i cant wait until the next one comes out too 
1126	1126	postive	um it it turns out that james fray who um i realy like 
1127	1127	postive	um he wrote a good book 
1128	1128	postive	um and i cant wait for the next one to come out 
1129	1129	postive	im really excited 
1130	1130	postive	um as for alex xxx i am a new alex fan 
1131	1131	postive	he was unbelievable 
1132	1132	postive	so easy on the eyes 
1133	1133	postive	um i think hes my new favorite 
1134	1134	postive	yeah so i suggest that you guys all watch this movie 
1135	1135	postive	main draw for me for this movie was just the fact that its set in this like ridiculous world with all these bright beautiful colors and ridiculous action sequences 
1136	1136	negative	and i dont think thats a very good movie 
1137	1137	postive	but i do think its a very interesting one 
1138	1138	negative	i can tell you that tron legacy is not a good movie 
1139	1139	postive	but i was still ridiculously entertained by it 
1140	1140	postive	are these two things possible in the same sentence i really do think so 
1141	1141	negative	tron legacy is a movie where on most counts that i judge movies it kind of fails 
1142	1142	negative	the performances are nah 
1143	1143	negative	the script can be horrible 
1144	1144	postive	its its a bit of a mixed bag coz there were some very bright moments 
1145	1145	negative	um the direction is a bit its wobbly 
1146	1146	negative	basically a lot of elements that i could take a movie on its really wobbly 
1147	1147	postive	but what it lacks in those areas it most definately makes up for just like sheer visual spectacle 
1148	1148	postive	i mean this movie has the most gorgeous visuals out of any movies since probably avatar me if not prettier 
1149	1149	postive	so many moments in this movie that are just framed and lit so perfectly that so that you just go like kind of huh thats really really cool 
1150	1150	postive	and then take that world that have been set like a crap tunnel of really kinetic really well done action sequences in it and you have tron legacy 
1151	1151	negative	it it doesnt make much sense i know 
1152	1152	negative	and basically this makes no sense 
1153	1153	postive	but it was a good movie 
1154	1154	postive	id give it three stars 
1155	1155	negative	only because it was very predictable very predictable 
1156	1156	negative	but very predictable 
1157	1157	negative	that um i guess the only other problem i had with it was that um the jokes were really cheesy 
1158	1158	neutral	i dont like cheesy jokes but cheesy jokes are most times funny cuz theyre really bad 
1159	1159	postive	so if thats the case then you should see this movie if you really like cheesy jokes predictable movies but other than that it was a perfect family movie 
1160	1160	postive	i would definitely take 8 or younger kids to that movie its a definite family movie 
1161	1161	negative	beyond this age the problem i had with the movie theatre is there were kids crying the whole time and whispering xxx does baby crying get on your nerves ever if it does wouldnt recommend going to this movie cuz theres a bunch of kids or sneak into a really late showing cuz i dont think kids are going to be out that late but thats the only problem i had with it 
1162	1162	postive	other than that it was a good movie 
1163	1163	postive	it was cute you know the actors did a great job bringing the smurfs to life such as joe george lopez neil patrick harris katy perry and a fourth 
1164	1164	postive	it was a great movie and i loved it 
1165	1165	postive	but i had a few problems so i didnt love it i liked it 
1166	1166	postive	three stars for smurfs and stay surf everyone 
1167	1167	postive	now i am a huge huge fan of nicholas sparks 
1168	1168	postive	um the notebook is one of my favorite films 
1169	1169	postive	um i really enjoyed a walk to remember me and dear john 
1170	1170	postive	i really did enjoy as well wasnt too fond of the ending 
1171	1171	postive	so i went into this film having quite high expectations 
1172	1172	postive	i mean its a nicholas sparks book it must be good 
1173	1173	negative	but on the other hand i was really um wary of going 
1174	1174	negative	like what to expect from miley cyrus um i mean shes only done the hannah montana franchise playing that one character which i think like 99 of the percent of the time her characters like so overboard shes so exaggerated so i really didnt know how she was going to handle this film 
1175	1175	negative	straight away miley cyrus acting miley cyrus acting or lack of she had this same expression throughout the entire film 
1176	1176	negative	it was like this like pouty like grumpy look 
1177	1177	negative	and then maybe even when she was happy like she wouldnt frown her um frown her eyebrows but shed still be pouty but like yeah like that 
1178	1178	negative	which just uh it really annoyed me 
1179	1179	negative	like those tho those those moments in the film especially in the beginning where she would sit there stand there cross um with her arms crossed and just look out into the distance like just laughing with the same expression or shed look across the beach or shed look at her dad or shed look at her brother with the same expression and i was just like where you thinking i i dont understand what this characters doing 
1180	1180	negative	like okay shes staring whats she thinking how does she feel i had no idea like it was the same expression for shock or for sadness or what i presumed shed be sad but it sigh it really bugged me 
1181	1181	negative	but as an actor i really think especially an actor in the lead leading role you really should prepare for that role 
1182	1182	negative	i was like how can you go into a film into a leading role and have no idea who your character is 
1183	1183	negative	smacking so thats probably why she just the same in every single scene there was probably about two scenes that i actually thought yea she this is her acting this is good she can do this 
1184	1184	negative	but then those two moments just got ruined by the rest of an hour and a half of her being pouty 
1185	1185	negative	save your money wait til it comes out on rental 
1186	1186	negative	for me it was a waste of time 
1187	1187	postive	there were a few funny lines 
1188	1188	negative	but after an hour i just said enough i had to walk out 
1189	1189	postive	the movie theatre gave me credit to a future movie so that i appreciate it 
1190	1190	postive	uh if you like the kind of movie that ben stiller did a night at the museum then you probably would like something uh like this 
1191	1191	negative	uh if you didnt like that type of movie then i really dont think youre gonna like this at all 
1192	1192	negative	and youre better off saving your money uh and maybe renting it when it comes out on uh video so 
1193	1193	negative	but uh theres definitely far better movies that you can uh go see than um tongue clicking than zookeeper 
1194	1194	negative	oh my gosh bad movie 
1195	1195	negative	really bad movie 
1196	1196	negative	i wish i weren 
1197	1197	postive	because i truly love an action flick action comedy flick even better right 
1198	1198	negative	but basically seth rogan brought none of the charm that he normally does to his roles 
1199	1199	negative	in fact i have to say that this was one of those obnoxious main characters ive seen a long time 
1200	1200	negative	yeap a horrible protagonist 
1201	1201	negative	he um had all the charm of a narcissist xxx boy the whole film 
1202	1202	negative	and unlike other films for they kind of a narcissistic xxx boy but they bring something to the table you know 
1203	1203	postive	theres something that just kind of makes tham so sl slightly endearing even though theyre kind of the jack ass you know 
1204	1204	postive	youre like oh theyre still kind of cool 
1205	1205	negative	no no hes unfunny not funny at all 
1206	1206	negative	um hes just a jack ass 
1207	1207	postive	um kato kicks ass handsome guy 
1208	1208	negative	boring 
1209	1209	negative	hes boring 
1210	1210	negative	just like look away what he can do he can do lots of stuff 
1211	1211	negative	what wa what hes what w why you have no skills whatsoever 
1212	1212	negative	you cant even tell funny jokes 
1213	1213	negative	and than cameron diaz whos supposed to be plucky i guess but shes just kind of useless 
1214	1214	negative	hi im pretty i have a giant smile im supposed to know things walk of screen 
1215	1215	negative	um yeah the characters didnt care weather they lived or died 
1216	1216	negative	kato was the only one that was any good whatsoever 
1217	1217	negative	and he was still boring 
1218	1218	neutral	um yeah the special effects were ok 
1219	1219	negative	nothing thats worth going to theaters to see 
1220	1220	negative	and yeah i think the only character who actually showed their motivation behind anything they did was the villain 
1221	1221	negative	he was the only character that was slightly interesting 
1222	1222	postive	who seemed to have genuine affection for other human beings 
1223	1223	postive	and it was kind of interesting 
1224	1224	negative	i mean the only character that shows genuine care for other people be the villain 
1225	1225	negative	hmm yeah skip it 
1226	1226	negative	dont see it 
1227	1227	postive	xxx seeing red riding hood for a really long time 
1228	1228	postive	and um ill just say overall if i think it was good 
1229	1229	postive	but um i liked it 
1230	1230	negative	i thought it could be really bad um but it didnt look like it would be but it could been 
1231	1231	postive	um i like did i thought catherine hardwicke did a good job 
1232	1232	negative	and um i liked you know catherine hardwicke is like you know kind of ridiculous 
1233	1233	negative	and she was kind of wierd during twilight 
1234	1234	postive	but um i i like seeing um female directors because there arent that many compare to you know guy directors 
1235	1235	postive	so the more like women directors that i see you know i i i like seeing that 
1236	1236	postive	so um i thought she did great with this movie 
1237	1237	postive	um anyway i would say just you go and see it if you were thinking about seeing it but you weren sure if it would be worth seeing 
1238	1238	postive	um i say go see it coz i i enjoyed it now 
1239	1239	negative	um i hm i dont like well i dont know if i wanna say i dont like this but i wish that it would been different who the wolf actually turned out to be 
1240	1240	negative	um i just i would like me and louis were saying we were thinking the whole time like who could be who could be 
1241	1241	neutral	um we had like we have guessed everybody um this like this random character dude who what does he do 
1242	1242	negative	i dont know how to like tell you who he is coz youre gonna be like that doesnt narrow it down at all 
1243	1243	negative	its just like this this character whos kind of random 
1244	1244	negative	and he i dont i think he maybe he got mad when hah i dont know 
1245	1245	postive	um but yeah whatever um he we thought it would be him because they weren showing him a lot but they showed him enough to they kind of be like oh it was him in the end 
1246	1246	negative	um a i wish we wished that it would been um the guy 
1247	1247	negative	um we wished it would been peter because it would made sense throat cleaning that um peter 
1248	1248	postive	like we wanted to be that she knew um amanda character knew it was peter but was pretending that she didnt so that she got a reason to run away with him and they could be together 
1249	1249	postive	and it would make sense 
1250	1250	postive	and and we kind of wanted it to be like but except not that obvious but that would been good right like coz that it would give tham a reason coz they wanted to get married but they couldn because she was gonna marry the other guy 
1251	1251	negative	and another thing the other guy she was supposed to marry was a hundred times better looking than peter 
1252	1252	postive	was nicer than peter 
1253	1253	postive	i was saying if shes not gonna marry him i will 
1254	1254	negative	because i thought he was um peter was annoying 
1255	1255	negative	i didnt like peter 
1256	1256	postive	im a big fan of the first tron 
1257	1257	postive	um i thought this is the perfect time to have a tron sequel 
1258	1258	postive	because um in at the beginning of the 1980s people thought that computers can do every every anything 
1259	1259	postive	and everything and now technology actually does anything and everything 
1260	1260	postive	because it kinda controls our lives so it was the perfect time for a tron sequel 
1261	1261	negative	unfortunately um the writers and i were not exactly on the same wavelength 
1262	1262	postive	lip smacking but i will say that the first third of this movie is amazing 
1263	1263	postive	its the best summer movie ive seen all year 
1264	1264	postive	but you know the pacing is so good 
1265	1265	postive	it gets straight into the story 
1266	1266	postive	you have lots of uh references to the first movie 
1267	1267	postive	you have new characters that actually have a connection to the old ones 
1268	1268	postive	and once sam flynn enters the grid you know the soundtrack draws you in 
1269	1269	postive	the special effects look amazing 
1270	1270	negative	uh they dont waste a lot of time on exposition 
1271	1271	postive	because the minute the enters the grid he is put in the games 
1272	1272	postive	and let me tell you the games look great 
1273	1273	postive	all those action sequences in involving the games were great to watch 
1274	1274	postive	um the cho the choreography of the fights the special effects i was so happy to be back in the grid that i wasnt really thinking about the story or where the story was going 
1275	1275	negative	but then sam flynn meets his father and tron basically turns into a star wars prequel after that one 
1276	1276	negative	disconnection then that happens at that point 
1277	1277	negative	the writers just pull this out of their ass 
1278	1278	negative	and the whole movie becomes about these crazy i i isos 
1279	1279	negative	and its just like or why do we need these things 
1280	1280	negative	it doesnt make any sense 
1281	1281	postive	because when the old flynn finds these things whatever they are theyre so wise and naive kinda like navi now that i think about it 
1282	1282	neutral	clue which is the program that he created in the first movie kinda pulls a bunny in the boiler moment in the sense that he turns into a crazy jealous psycho stalker bitch 
1283	1283	negative	and clue has to be one of the most idiotic villains ever cause what is a what is clue 
1284	1284	neutral	for some kind of freaky teleportation 
1285	1285	negative	and its like youre a computer program okay if you want to take over the world using real people its the worst way you could possibly do that infiltrate some computer system somewhere and detonate some nukes or something 
1286	1286	postive	and it was actually pretty good 
1287	1287	negative	um i was expecting seth rogan to be a little bit more serious in this movie but he wasnt 
1288	1288	negative	he was the same old goofy seth rogan that we all know 
1289	1289	postive	um but it was still a good film 
1290	1290	postive	um i think that i mean i had fun with it 
1291	1291	postive	so to me thats a pretty good movie 
1292	1292	negative	and um because of that i was expecting seth rogan to maybe try to be a little bit more serious but he wasnt 
1293	1293	postive	but you know thats ok i guess 
1294	1294	postive	um i still had fun with it 
1295	1295	postive	um the car the black beauty that was amazing all the guns even the car over there that was really sweet 
1296	1296	postive	and all the action scenes were great 
1297	1297	postive	the special effects were great and the guy who played kato whose first name is j 
1298	1298	postive	um he was good 
1299	1299	postive	he played kato perfectly 
1300	1300	postive	and he did a great job 
1301	1301	postive	um the acting was was pretty good 
1302	1302	postive	and the action was good 
1303	1303	postive	um i would definately recommend you go see it in theaters 
1304	1304	postive	coz take a bunch of your friends because you you guys will have a good time 
1305	1305	neutral	youll have fun 
1306	1306	postive	and youll laugh 
1307	1307	postive	it is funny its a funny movie 
1308	1308	postive	lots of lots of laugh out loud moment i guess you could say 
1309	1309	postive	but um yeah go check it out 
1310	1310	postive	its one its one to check out in theaters i would say 
1311	1311	postive	um sniff but yeah so the green hornet it was ok 
1312	1312	negative	i expected a little bit more seriousness 
1313	1313	postive	but it was still good 
1314	1314	postive	it get it gets pretty serious 
1315	1315	postive	and um fun at the end 
1316	1316	postive	too pretty intense at the end 
1317	1317	negative	its bad 
1318	1318	negative	oh god this is bad 
1319	1319	negative	im not even gonna go to the lows to make a whole night video about this movie 
1320	1320	negative	so no now know this i am not a fan of the final destination series 
1321	1321	negative	i hate it 
1322	1322	neutral	i might have to watch the first two again or maybe just the first one to stabilize my thoughts on the series 
1323	1323	negative	but as far as im concerned this series is garbage 
1324	1324	negative	you can sense my excitement when i heard this was being released 
1325	1325	negative	now i wont even talk about acting coz its just so bad 
1326	1326	negative	its a joke really 
1327	1327	postive	now let just get into two things that will possibly attract you to this film the violence and the 3d 
1328	1328	negative	viewers please resist from these two 
1329	1329	negative	the violence here is pretty bad 
1330	1330	negative	there about two creative scenes in here um one being in intestinal journey through the rectum in a swimming pool drain and a tire decapitation that 
1331	1331	neutral	the tire decapitation might not sound all that unique 
1332	1332	postive	but the way its pulled off its like wow that was sick 
1333	1333	postive	i mean not the sick like oh my god that was awesome 
1334	1334	negative	no sick in the oh my god that was crazy that kind of sick 
1335	1335	negative	theres many different ways of saying sick nowadays 
1336	1336	negative	but um yeah wow agh say that in two shee two scenes death isnt even nearly unique is a bit harsh 
1337	1337	postive	the race stadium scene and the mall scenes in the beginning and the end where massive amounts of people die in the craziest ways are pretty good for late night buddy viewing you see you know what i mean by late night buddy viewings 
1338	1338	postive	this is his most engaging endeavour yet 
1339	1339	postive	and he what he does with hanna is he makes the movie on like anything weve seen before 
1340	1340	postive	he takes great actors or actresses in this case like saoirse ronan and cate blanchett 
1341	1341	neutral	and he puts them in very strange and unusual characters 
1342	1342	postive	um what really need about this movie is the chemical brothers did the soundtracks whats pulse pounding the entire way through 
1343	1343	postive	you never know whats gonna happen 
1344	1344	postive	theres all these colorful characters 
1345	1345	neutral	now it isnt a great fantastic tell everybody about that kind of movie 
1346	1346	postive	i gave it a b 
1347	1347	postive	but i think its one of those movies thats so unique 
1348	1348	postive	that you respect that joe wright tried to do something completely different here 
1349	1349	postive	its colorful 
1350	1350	postive	its in your face 
1351	1351	postive	its really non stop from beginning to end 
1352	1352	postive	and i think um what i took away from this was that really tried very hard to make something original 
1353	1353	postive	and something that i cant find anything else to compare it to 
1354	1354	postive	and i was unbelievably shocked how much i loved it 
1355	1355	postive	it was full of action 
1356	1356	postive	great dialogue 
1357	1357	postive	the characters were so great and well developed 
1358	1358	postive	its really just a heart warming story 
1359	1359	postive	its a great movie to see over and over again your whole family can see it 
1360	1360	negative	its not that violent 
1361	1361	neutral	xxx it is a bit violent and not enough so you can bring your 5 year old 
1362	1362	postive	i really realy felt for the dad in the expendables 
1363	1363	postive	because he was protecting over his family and after they went missing even though theyre a bend of outsiders and thay have all those powers 
1364	1364	postive	the dad was just really protective 
1365	1365	postive	and he made sure that hes whole family was safe 
1366	1366	postive	very heart warming 
1367	1367	postive	very touching 
1368	1368	postive	brad bird is a great writer and director 
1369	1369	postive	um i think that my favorite part of the entire movie was when you find out at the end that the little baby had powers 
1370	1370	postive	it was so cute 
1371	1371	postive	just the great great movie 
1372	1372	postive	i really recommend you all see the expendables 
1373	1373	postive	my boyfriend got really excited when i told him we were gonna go see the expandable 
1374	1374	negative	and than um when i went to blockbuster and i picked it up and i brought it back home he got really disappointed 
1375	1375	postive	i think its because it was such a moving film 
1376	1376	negative	and i dont think he knows how to handle his emotions in that department 
1377	1377	negative	so it was just a little awkward 
1378	1378	negative	so it was just a little awkward 
1379	1379	postive	but um weve overcome that 
1380	1380	neutral	you know a lot of people have been talking about the expendables even though it came out such a long time ago 
1381	1381	negative	theres been a lot of buzz about it lately and everyone you know a lot of controversy over it 
1382	1382	postive	everyone been saying its really intense 
1383	1383	postive	i can see that 
1384	1384	neutral	there are parts that are very intense 
1385	1385	postive	but for the most part it is a family friendly warm and fuzzy 
1386	1386	postive	so go see the expendables 
1387	1387	postive	i know you guys are gonna love it 
1388	1388	negative	this movie was horrible 
1389	1389	negative	nicholas cage should not do these kind of movies 
1390	1390	postive	hes always in these kinds of movies all this sorcerer witch voodoo kind of movies 
1391	1391	negative	and its getting really tiring 
1392	1392	negative	hes horrible at it 
1393	1393	negative	no one takes him seriously 
1394	1394	negative	w w w when hes onscreen i want to punch him in the face 
1395	1395	negative	hes very boring 
1396	1396	negative	he wa he was very annoying 
1397	1397	negative	he didnt know what he was talking about 
1398	1398	negative	and i was sitting in the theatre sleeping 
1399	1399	postive	he was very good in hellboy 
1400	1400	negative	but in this movie he wasnt good at all 
1401	1401	negative	i i i didnt really care for his character at all 
1402	1402	negative	hes very boring as well 
1403	1403	negative	whole movies very boring 
1404	1404	negative	it made no sense 
1405	1405	negative	i didnt really care about it at all 
1406	1406	negative	i had no idea why i even saw this movie 
1407	1407	postive	uh the trailer looked like it could be a little g good 
1408	1408	negative	but when i saw it was just totally boring 
1409	1409	negative	but it wasnt really made well 
1410	1410	negative	and this is the worst by far 
1411	1411	negative	it was very very very boring 
1412	1412	negative	made no sense 
1413	1413	negative	action sense were very dumb 
1414	1414	negative	i hated it 
1415	1415	negative	but the last half hour of the movie it felt like they had added like a cgi orgasm 
1416	1416	negative	you know they just tried uh with the cgi that they put t t t they they threw so much cgi at you 
1417	1417	negative	and it was awful 
1418	1418	negative	like it was like spewing cgi last half hour of the movie 
1419	1419	negative	like every single scene was cgi 
1420	1420	negative	it was terrible 
1421	1421	negative	i hated it 
1422	1422	negative	i was sitting there in the theatre laughing how bad the movie was at some points 
1423	1423	negative	uh huh how about the acting and the action was was just so dull 
1424	1424	negative	and boring 
1425	1425	negative	do not see this movie 
1426	1426	negative	season of the witch was horrible acting 
1427	1427	negative	dull 
1428	1428	negative	just dont see this movie 
1429	1429	negative	i dont know why i even saw it 
1430	1430	negative	so season of the witch is rated 3 out of 10 
1431	1431	negative	its one of those romantic comedies that we all dread 
1432	1432	postive	now the real star of something borrowed is ginnifer goodwin 
1433	1433	negative	annoyingly she kind of yells and screams through the whole movie 
1434	1434	negative	and if you can tolerate her the rest of the movie isnt any batter 
1435	1435	negative	um it kind of follows the path of my best friends wedding 1997 julia roberts movie except it takes thirty minutes longer to deviate from the scripts of my best friends wedding 
1436	1436	postive	there are some funny moments 
1437	1437	negative	but mostly its just kate hudson being very annoying 
1438	1438	negative	and i think its predictable up an to a point 
1439	1439	postive	i think with with these kind of movies we kind of predict 
1440	1440	neutral	and we second guess ourselves 
1441	1441	postive	so i will give it points for not being exactly like my best friends wedding even at the trailer sets it up that way 
1442	1442	postive	ginnifer goodwin is fun to watch 
1443	1443	negative	but i dont think shes leading material 
1444	1444	negative	and like i said kate hudson couldnt be more annoying here 
1445	1445	postive	if there is any in this movie its john krasinski 
1446	1446	neutral	who i dont usually like 
1447	1447	postive	but he has some of the funniest scenes in this movie 
1448	1448	negative	he seems to be the only realistic character here
